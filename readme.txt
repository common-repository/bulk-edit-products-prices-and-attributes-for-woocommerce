With this plugin, you can bulk edit Simple product fields such as SKU, Catalog Visibility, Stock, Quantity, Regular Price, Sale Price, Shipping Class, Weight and Dimensions.

This bulk edit plugin allows you to edit multiple products at a time. 

The best part of the plugin is that it can update the attributes for thousands of products in a single instance. So you do not need to navigate to multiple pages to get the changes reflected in the overview order page.

You can filter the products to edit using the Filter Interface provided by the Plugin Settings. Filters can be applied using various parameters like Type of the Product, Category of the Product, Attributes, Price, etc. You will be able to edit as many products as you want in just one step and edit fields such as SKU, Stock, Regular Price, Sale Price, Weight, Height, etc. The complete list is given below.
You can even increase or decrease all prices in a category by a set percentage % or dollar value $ for quick sales or product price increases/decreases all in one step.
